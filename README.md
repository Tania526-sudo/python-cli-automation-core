## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a **production-ready Python CLI application** built with a strong focus on **software engineering best practices**.

The project serves as a **foundational template for scalable automation and data-processing tools**, showcasing clean architecture, modular design, testing, packaging, and containerization.

While the demo functionality is intentionally simple, the **engineering patterns are directly applicable** to real-world data, GIS, and AI systems.

## Key Engineering Concepts Demonstrated

- Modular **OOP-based architecture**
- Command-line interface (CLI) design
- Data persistence & serialization
- Automated testing with **pytest**
- Dependency & package management with **Poetry**
- Docker-based containerization
- Clean separation of core logic, I/O, and configuration
